Todo:
- Add open logs button (maybe on the error message?)
- Add more providers
- Add more / all js providers
- Make sure provider image is never wider than window
- Add Themer from other project to replace current theme impl
- Make Theme Progressbar to be thicker
- Update update check (check list for every [major minor patch, dev stage e.g. b2], combination it wants to be reminded of)
 -> scrape new updates from github releases instead of a json file
- Implement better shader system
- Enable method to disable certain inputs (called everytime an input changes)
- Chromatic aberration

- OTHER PROVS:
 -> Mangapark
 -> Luacomic
 -> https://whalemanga.com

Not planned:
- should automatic downscale be mega pixel based? -> No because we do not say "This is quality and this isn't" but relative to currently, this is quality
- Make it possible to transfer from one library to another by reusing can use library as can use title as path?
-> Too deep for normal people to understand, would have to select uuid4 folder of the title as the path, which is hard if you don't understand it in-depth
- Make library providers compatible with one another? How to solve different provider for different chapters?
- execute similar commands (like 3x double res) in one go. This would only be useful when the image is literally 3 by 3 px large

Done:
- Only clean own appdata folder like "175b1"
- Test out widgets other than slider and combobox  -> fixed them
- Is vert shader executed? If yes why isnt the image flipped each time?
