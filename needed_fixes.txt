- scrollbar doesnt work with touch screen
- touch screen input way to sensitive
- progress dialog doesn't show over the stay on top flagged qmainapplication

- touch screen input with more than one finger needed (maybe gestures like zooming, but lower priority right now)
- flickering of image edges, when scrolling or in right vertical position ( Maybe overlay images one pixel or so? )
- better speed for loading chapters
-> preloading of the previous and the next chapter?
- better exporting of chapters
- adding support for text only and video (plugins)
