- chapter selector not reverting back, when chapter is invalid # Fixed
-> Don't save all changes to db, only those that worked (let chapter methods handle it)
-> Maybe do same for title (better not, titles are unlikely to have same problem as chapters)
- fix overlaying of images on to side menu, when reloading (next chapter, etc.) # Fixed
-> Repaint
- popups for events (like failed to load [next] chapter) # Fixed

- better handeling of chapter loading times
- better exporting of chapters
- better speed for loading chapters
-> preloading of the previous and the next chapter
- adding support for text only and video (plugins)
- add indirect and direct mode (indirect, what direct is at the moment, direct use the href from website
to go to next chapter, etc. --> direct would require a start manga url [could potentially also extract it from chapter url])
- title and chapter shown as name next to manhwaviewer
- add support for anime and comic compilation videos
